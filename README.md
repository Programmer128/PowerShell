PowerShell Scripts for Active Directory or File Systems

The Move-GroupsByMembersDepartmentExample.ps1 is an Active Directory group reorganization script. It goes through all the groups in a domain, finds employee, student, computer, empty, and other groups, such as ones with all disabled members, and moves them into Active Directory Organizational Units based on Division OU/Department OU. The OU a groups is moved to is based on the department with the most members in the group. Groups with members from more than 3 departments are moved to an OU at the Division level. Which division OU they are moved to is based on which division has the most members in the group. Empty groups are moved to a single OU set up for that purpose. Groups with a majority of student members are also moved to a Students groups OU. Division organizational units and child department OUs are created on the fly if they do not exist before the first group is moved into them.

The Get-SharePermissions.ps1 script iterates through a server's shared folders and their subfolders and writes ACL information to file. A PSObject is used to keep track of the share path/group name/permissions information.

The Set-GroupDescriptionsFromFile.ps1 reads a CVS file with data on server shares ACLs, and always writes the UNC path of the first share found in the file to which a group has access for writing to the Active Directory group's description attribute when a 2nd script is run. If there are other shares the group has access to then those are written, one UNC path per line, to the file. Since the notes attribute has a 1024 character limit, the script keeps track of the number of characters written to the notes attribute and stops writing group share access information to file if an UNC path would exceed that character limit for a group's Active Directory notes attribute.
A separate script reads this resulting file and writes the data to all the groups' description and notes attributes.
